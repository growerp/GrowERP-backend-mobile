        "description": "<p>The system is prepared to print receipts automatically when an order is created in preparation areas like bar and kitchen and when the billed option is pressed in the table detail page. In order to be able to print directly from your phone/tablet, you need a receipt printer. Just a cheap ESCPOS ip network printer will do, either WIFI or cable. We Advice to use a normal Ethernet cable and connect it to your router. if you installed the printer you need to know its ip address in the form of 192.168.X.XX.</p><p>You can find it by making your printer do a selftest:<br />1. switch power off.<br />2. push the feed button and keep it pressed until about 2-3 seconds after you switched on the power at the seem time you keep the feed button pressed.<br />3. on the selftest print you can find the IP address.</p><p>Now go the setup/prepare area definition and enter the IP address there.</p>",
