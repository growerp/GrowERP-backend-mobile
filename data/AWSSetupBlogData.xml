                    many people think the implementation of open source ERP is similar to a
                    commercial ERP implementation, we found a remarkable number of
                    differences.<br><br>These
                    differences are caused by the different nature of the ERP system: Open
                    source ERP has the program sources supplied, is free of commercial
                    licenses and free to download from the Internet: so complete freedom for
                    the end user. This will impact the implementation significantly.<br>Freedom
                    is the key word, you can organize the implementation as you want it, no
                    limitations can be imposed on to you by the implementation support
                    company or the owner of the software (some license limitations may
                    apply, be careful which ERP you select)<br><br>The implementation differences between open source ERP and a commercial system:</p><ol><li><strong>Project implementation organization freedom.<br></strong>If
                    you really wanted, you can do it all yourself, with no help from
                    anybody. However, implementing ERP is a specialist job, for which you
                    better hire a company for whom implementing ERP systems is their core
                    business. Try working together with this company so you also get a
                    technology transfer to your employees.</li><li><strong>Implementation support company selection.</strong><br>Finding
                    a qualified implementation company can be a challenge, however look at
                    the ERP system website, there is a section of companies providing
                    support services. You can also check the ERP system forum or mailing
                    lists for participants or check which companies contribute a lot to the
                    system. They are often also the best providers.</li><li><strong>No cost limitation on modules or functions</strong><br>A lot
                    of companies, start with accounting and then find out that additional
                    components are expensive, actually very expensive, so the purchase of
                    these additional components are at least delayed. Open source is free so
                    this limitation does not exist and you can aim to use the system in all
                    departments of your company.</li><li><strong>Order sequence of implementation.</strong><br>Commercial ERP
                    implementation often starts with the accounting module. Open source ERP
                    systems often start from the e-commerce- or marketing and sales module
                    and accounting last. Open source accounting still can be tricky because
                    accountant want to see well known accounting software and are often the
                    most conservative employees in the company.</li><li><strong>Is a contract required for implementation?</strong><br>This
                    is dependent on the implementation support company which supports the
                    open source product. We can only say, we do not do implementation
                    contracts, in the spirit of the product, the implementation has just as
                    much freedom as the product has. Just start implementing with frequent
                    invoices and the implementation can be stopped at any time. To make this
                    possible, implementation starts with a small team and is later extended
                    when is proven the open source ERP implementation is going well.</li><li><strong>Customizing easy so why not create a new menu shell?</strong><br>Open
                    source ERP system customizing is easy, so do not hesitate to create
                    menus specifically designed for the employee functions in your company.
                    He/she sees just the functions required which eases the acceptance.</li><li><strong>Is upgrading, when customizing, a problem?</strong><br>In
                    general it should not, but it is depending on the open source system
                    selected and if the vendor follows the implementation guidelines. Ask
                    what it would cost if you would like to upgrade the base system monthly,
                    then you know from the start if the customization will be done
                    properly.</li><li><strong>Implementation methodology.</strong><br>In general open
                    source implementation companies follow the latest developments, not only
                    in technology, but also in implementation methods. They are often using
                    the newer project management methodologies like Scrum for
                    implementation, although combined with Prince2 for the management
                    organization and reporting. <a href="http://www.borselaer.org/index.php/2010/03/whitebook-prince2-combined-with-scrum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(check here for more info)</a>
                    The advantage is that during the implementation the end user can change
                    his mind for the parts which are not yet implemented but part of the
                    project.</li></ol>Please enter your opinions or comments here or sent them to support@antwebsystems.com.]]></fileData>

            <fileData><![CDATA[It depends on which open source ERP system you select for your
                    enterprise. Sure there are a number of systems suitable for large
                    organizations. To help you select the best system for you, we have
                    listed below a number of criteria which are important in your selection.<br><br><strong>1. Functionality</strong><br>
                    Does the system have roughly the functionality your company or
                    enterprise requires? It will never fit completely, but this is no
                    problem, since open source can be easily adapted. Is it multi- company
                    and currency? Has it at least the functions you intend to use? In
                    general you need accounting, product catalog/warehouse, sales/purchase
                    order, manufacturing, marketing/sales, CRM , data warehouse(BI) and
                    e-commerce. <br><br><strong>2. Adaptability</strong><br> Can the system
                    be customized and still can it be easily upgraded to newer versions?
                    Customizations should always be kept outside the core ERP system so the
                    core system can be upgraded pretty frequently. <br><br><strong>3. Scalability and technology.</strong><br>
                    In order that you system can be accessed via the Internet it is
                    required that the system is web based and that it can be used from
                    within a browser. Does it require additional commercial software such as
                    operating systems and/or databases? Can the system be scaled to a large
                    number of users? <br>In general it can be said that if the Java
                    technology is used it can scale using multiple Java applications
                    servers, behind a load balancer and accessing the same database server.
                    Other technologies are either commercial or are not so suitable for
                    large installations.<br><br><strong>4. Is the system really open source?</strong><br>
                    Many companies promote their system using the term 'open source' for
                    marketing purposes only. Sure there can be made available a 'community
                    version' with limited functionality where it is always required to
                    purchase extra components to make it usable in large organizations. A
                    further trick is to make an open source version of the system available
                    but with a pretty restricted open source license on it. You can then buy
                    a less restricted license to use and replicate it in large
                    organizations<br> Also be careful if the system is owned by a commercial
                    company and not a foundation. It is understandable that it is mandatory
                    for this company that profit has to be made. Even be more careful when
                    investors are involved, then making profit is even more important. If
                    the software is owned by a foundation this situation does not exist. <br><br><strong>4. Future of the system.</strong><br>
                    Make sure there is a lively community which keeps the system up to date
                    with modern technology and newer business requirements. Check if there
                    are plenty of providers and users worldwide. Did you know that additions
                    to the system are often contributed by providers and financed by
                    end-users?<br><br><strong>5. Available support/provider companies.</strong><br>
                    Check if a suitable provider is available which has experience
                    implementing open source ERP in large organizations, that they have a
                    proper implementation methodology and can also support you when the
                    system is in production. References to existing implementations
                    certainly can help. If you want to do work yourself, does this company
                    provide you with knowledge transfer?<br><br>As usual leave comments or mail us at support@antwebsystems.com]]>

                    experiences implementing open source ERP in large organizations which we
                    are doing now for over two years. The target audience for these
                    articles is management level executives and later in this series the
                    high level technically oriented functions because there is where the
                    strength of the ERP system is we are using.<br><br>Questions related to reliability, maturity, support, cost savings,
                    locking-in and comparison with commercial software will be answered. To
                    be sure your questions will be answered let us know your question via a

                    we will focus more at the Apache OFBiz product which is the system we
                    use and which is, in our opinion, best for larger organizations because
                    of the Java technology, the included development framework, its generous
                    license and its ownership of the Apache foundation.<br><br>The subjects we will cover in the upcoming articles are:<ul><li>Why open source ERP and not a commercial system?</li><li>Is open source ERP ready for large organizations?</li><li>About freedom of lock-in, 'open' and implementation transparency.</li><li>Save large amounts of money using open source ERP in multiple locations</li><li>Implementing open source ERP different from commercial systems?</li><li>Our open source ERP implementation method explained.</li><li>Implement open source ERP yourself or get help?</li><li>Replacing your commercial accounting ERP with an open source system.</li></ul><br>if you have a suggestions for additional subjects let us

                    locking you in? In our software development company with 20+ employees
                    we do not use commercial software.</p> What do we use? We use Ubuntu on our laptops and work stations,
                    Eclipse for software development, SVN and Git (yes we are just
                    migrating) for our repositories. For administration we use Libre Office
                    and Gimp for image handling. On our production systems we use Ubuntu
                    server, PostgreSQL and yes, our core business, which is the only product
                    we support: Apache OFBiz open source ERP.<p>I just read a nice
                    article about the city of Munich where they just finished their
                    migration project which showed how organizations get locked in and need
                    10 years to get out of it.</p><p>We were lucky starting straight away
                    with open source 7 years ago and did not have that problem. Are there
                    exceptions? sure, we have 2 old laptops to be able to check if our
                    software works with IE.</p><p>So if you are in the process upgrading
                    your commercial software in your company consider the option to use open
                    source software instead.</p><p>check for the Munich experiences at :

If however you would like to rent video's or cars or motorcycles the system should support its delivery with a shipment and return process what the system currently not provides.
            </p><br><p>These rent-able items are owned by the company and are normally stored as assets which can be depreciated by the accounting process. Their value is also determined there. We need however to store them somewhere so a link to an inventory item related to the rent-able product needs to be created which is currently missing in OFBiz. We added a field in the inventory item entity to achieve that.
            </p><br><p>So when a shippable rental product is ordered, an inventory item related to the rent-able product will be reserved by the order which relates in turn to the the actual asset. When the order is completed a return of type of 'rental' with the reason 'normal return' will be created so the warehouse knows and recognizes the item when it comes back in. </p><br><p>The order and shipment slip will list the product and the asset number, so the warehouse knows where to find the item.
            This shipment and return process however should not affect accounting what it currently does, also no refund should be given when the rental item is returned.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">Implementation in OFBiz. </span><br></p><p>In revision 1167015 we have added the changes for this function. It uses most of the functions of the product-type 'Asset Usage'. In order however to store the item and link is created from the fixedAsset to the inventory item entity in the warehouse location where the rental product can be stored. When an order is received for renting the item, it is taken from inventory, handed or shipped to the customer. When it is shipped a return is created automatically with a RA# (Return Authorization #) which will be used when the rental item is returned. <br>Make sure the SECA of accounting is not activated when shipping or returning.</p><p>As usual let us know if we can help at support@antwebsystems.com</p><p><br></p> ]]>

            <fileData><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Introduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new product type represents the service to a particular product which is brought in by the customer. Examples are equipment and computer repair, cleaning of clothes etc. Currently the OFBiz system has a product type of service but it does not support the logistics of the brought in- and returned (shipped) item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The business process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A customer sends or hands in the product item(s). An order is created selecting the related generic productId's (Catalog product examples are&amp;nbsp; “Desktop computer repair' , 'T-shirt cleaning'&amp;nbsp; etc) to be serviced, and entering an inventory location or let the system assign it. The products are brought to that warehouse location waiting for the service to be applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the service is finished the shipment and packing process will be started for the products to be delivered or picked up. At the same time an invoice is created with the (updated) price information from the order. When a payment is received it can be entered in the system and the transaction booked to the ledger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Implementation in OFBiz,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main commit is in rev 1166543 and is relatively simple. When an order item is added with a product of type 'Product service' a warehouse receive product process is started which results in a warehouse location where the item can be temporary stored. The inventory item is then reserved for the same order so the correct item is shipped after service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This service process could be supported by the manufacturing component but that depends on the complexity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need support for the implementation or any other help?

                Sitemaps</a> so web developers can publish lists of links from across

                of dynamic pages that are only available through the use of forms and
                user entries. The Sitemap files contains URLs to these pages so that

                used where a crawler cannot find all the pages under it.This component supports multiple websites on the same system and
                can generate a sitemap xml for each.<br></p><br><p>There are three methods to get url's in this file:
                </p><ol>
                <li>Having products in categories under a catalog in a product store on the website.</li>

                <![CDATA[<p>This blog is a follow up <a target="_blank" title="The first OFBiz scrum blog" href="http://www.antwebsystems.com/control/ViewBlogArticle?contentId=16718&amp;blogContentId=AWS_BLOG">of the earlier blog</a> I wrote introducing
                  the OFBiz scrum component we use in our Scrum projects we do for
                  customers all over the world. This blog assumes you have the
                  knowledge explained there.</p><p>We are now using the Scrum methodology (framework) for almost one
                  year and it improved our development process considerable. We did
                  however add a number of extra function to the Scrum framework like QA an unplanned backlog items.</p><p><strong>What did improve?</strong></p><ol>
                  <li>The development process is now completely transparent to the
                  customer/product owner.</li>
                  <li>All software updates are recorded in svn and are visible in
                  the scrum component for team members and QA (Quality Assurance).</li>
                  <li>Much more formal and documented way of implementation with
                  allows top level specifications to be estimated.</li>
                  <li>We use Chat for the scrum meetings in the morning which show
                  to the customer what is happening on a daily basis.</li>
                  <li>We can invoice on a backlog item level to which a customer
                  can relate.</li>
                  </ol><p>We think that using scrum in a outsourcing environment needs
                  a supporting system. We used it for a number of customers and the OFBiz
                  scrum component works very well here. </p><p><strong>However we made a number of extensions to the Scrum framework:</strong></p><ol>
                  <li>Next to the planned backlog we now also allow for unplanned,
                  urgent backlog items which can be added to a 'unplanned' sprint
                  which is running continuously. These unplanned items always take
                  priority above the planned items.</li>
                  <li>We introduced a QA function where backlog items are tested by
                  a separate QA group who are able to add 'error' tasks and can
                  approve the completion of a backlogitem. A function has been added
                  which enables the listing of completed backlogitems which are not
                  tested yet.</li>
                  <li>In order to track the time spend in meetings, for every
                  sprint, backlogitems for this purpose are automatically added.</li>
                  <li>We now achieved a full integration with SVN where SVN updates
                  are listed on a task, backlog, product, system and committer level
                  with the possibility to show the actual changes made on a source
                  line level.</li>
                  <li>We now also have a link to the HR component for people to
                  register the vacation/sick days in the scrum time sheet.</li>
                  <li>It is now also possible to send and receive email on a
                  product and backlog level to enable the communication between the
                  product owner and scrum team.</li>
                  <li>We added the role of stakeholder who has read access to the
                  products of his company.</li>
                  </ol><p><strong>What is planned for the future?</strong></p><ol>
                  <li>create an internal chat system to have daily scrum meetings
                  directly integrated with a sprint</li>
                  <li>Allow a customer to enter error reports against existing
                  backlog items./li&gt;
                  </li></ol><br><p>So in general this is an excellent experience using this Scrum

                <![CDATA[<p>We have now completed the implementation of optionally SEO
                  friendly url's on categories and products. The implementation is
                  fully compatible with the existing url definition and can be added to
                  exiting sites using the old url's. We have added alternative url's to all the demo categories and
                  products in the e-commerce component for demonstration.<br></p><p>Have a look in the demo system at product
                  <a href="http://demo-trunk.ofbiz.apache.org/ecommerce/giant-widget-with-variant-explosion-WG-9943-p">WG-9943</a> You see here that the url is build from the description, the
                  productId and a 'p' to indicate it is a product url. A 'c' is used
                  for the categories.This url is completely configurable and it is even possible to
                  have more than a single url for the same product or have url's in
                  different languages dependent on the current locale! If you are switching to ofbiz you can even import your old url's<br>
                  </p><p>You can create and modify this url in the catalog component. As an
                  example select&nbsp; <a href="https://demo-trunk.ofbiz.apache.org/catalog/control/EditProduct?productId=WG-9943&amp;USERNAME=admin&amp;PASSWORD=ofbiz&amp;JavaScriptEnabled=Y">WG-9943</a> in the back-end and click on the content tab. There you see the already generated url and click on it. In the textbox lower on the screen, you see the existing url. Replace the text with: this is a test <br></p><p>Now the product can be requested under the url:<br><a href="http://demo-trunk.ofbiz.apache.org/ecommerce/this-is-a-test-WG-9943-p">http://demo-trunk.ofbiz.apache.org/ecommerce/this-is-a-test-WG-9943-p</a><br><br>Although these url's can be set manually we have also provided an
                  automatic way using the names of the categories or products. Go to
                  the catalog component, select catalogs from the top menu, select the
                  catalog from the list and press the 'create seo categories/products'
                  button, the system will report the number of url's added. It will not
                  replace already existing alternative url's.</p><p>
                  <strong>Using this in your existing E-Commerce.</strong>
                  <br>-Use the @ofbizCatalogAltUrl macros instead of the @ofbizUrl macro.<br>-Install the CatalogUrlFilter in your web.xml
                  <br><br>Check the special purpose e-commerce component how it is done.<br><br>You need help? Let us know at

                <![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The best way to demonstrate this integration of data is to send out a demo order in the standard demo information which can be loaded in the system. When the order is 'quick shipped' and 'paid' you can see a nice demonstration of the automatically posted accounting information together with the demo order, products, inventory and the customer information all accessible from the order overview screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see this order in the OFBiz &lt;a href=&quot;https://demo-trunk.ofbiz.apache.org/ordermgr/control/orderview?orderId=DEMO10090&amp;amp;USERNAME=admin&amp;amp;PASSWORD=ofbiz&amp;amp;JavaScriptEnabled=Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;demo system&lt;/a&gt;. The initial status is 'approved'. You can get the status to completed by the following actions so it will show up in the accounting ledger. (if not already done by other users)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;'Complete' the order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.Under action press the 'Quickship entire order' button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.Under payment information click on the payments '10001' button and on the next screen click on the button 'status to confirmed' to indicate the order was paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Now you can check the created data on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://demo-trunk.ofbiz.apache.org/ordermgr/control/orderview?orderId=DEMO10090&amp;amp;USERNAME=admin&amp;amp;PASSWORD=ofbiz&amp;amp;JavaScriptEnabled=Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;order overview screen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.Accounting information: (In the order payment section): Invoice, payment, Trial balance (Accounting/ org setting/accounting/trial balance) and ledger detail at the bottom of the Invoice and payment screens.&lt;br&gt;As you can see accounting was completely automatic: the ledger is updated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.Product information. (order items): Pricing, Inventory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Customer information: All orders from this customer, Visit information: the the user logged on to the system, Contact information like postal address, email telephone etc, any communication with this customer either per email.

Anybody, when registered,&amp;nbsp; can add links in the available categories and yes sure, the site is implemented using OFBiz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Does it solve the above points?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point 1,2 is not solved with this site, however the other points are certainly improved:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We now have a central index pointing to documents on any site.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because documents are shown on the original site, it is shown who owns it and is rewarded by high focussed visitors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A category tree, search and keyword cloud is provided to easily find documents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A twitter and google +1 buttons are provided for promotion. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possibility to advertise to highly motivated visitors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So please have a look to the site, register and add&amp;nbsp;links to your website and receive more visitors: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://ofbiz.info/&quot;&gt;http://ofbiz.info.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our plans for the future?

                <![CDATA[<p>A rather old function in OFBiz which we just discovered and extended&nbsp;is the usage of more than one domain name as the root
                e-commerce application or multiple domains on a single web
                application.</p><br><p>There are three main reasons why you want this:</p><br><br><ol>
                <p>
                </p><li>you have different domain names for the different languages
                of the same website.</li>
                <li>You have a number of different websites/shops you want to
                mount as the root application.
                </li><li>You want more security for your back-end applications like
                catalog and accounting.
                </li></ol><p>
                </p><p></p><p>
                </p><br><p><strong>Domain is only used for that Specific web Application.</strong><br>As we said this functionality is in OFBiz but it has a limitation,
                which is also a feature:<br>if you specify a virtual host on a web
                application like e-commerce, that virtual host name can only be used
                for that specific web application and not on other web applications
                where the virtual host is not specified. If you still do that, you
                get a page not found error.&nbsp;So you have to use a different domain name for the applications
                where the the virtual hosts are not specified and which points to the
                same OFBiz installation.</p><br><p><strong>Added security.</strong><br>However this is also a feature as mentioned in point 3: on this
                separate domain name you can put more security restrictions like only
                allowing certain IP numbers as the one of the company gateway router.
                Then employees can only login to the back-end when they are at work.&nbsp;At the same time this prevents e-commerce public users using the
                back-end through the ecommerce component. So specifying a virtual
                host on your even single domain e-commerce website provides more
                security.</p><p><br></p><p>
                <strong>How do you use it?</strong> <br>Add a virtual-host line to your &lt;webapp in ofbiz-component.xml.
                Example:&nbsp;<br><br>&lt;webapp name="abc"
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;title="Abc"
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;server="default-server"
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;location="webapp/abc"
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;mount-point="/"
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;app-bar-display="false"&gt;
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;virtual-host host-name="abc.com"/&gt;&nbsp;<br>&lt;/webapp&gt;&nbsp;<br><br>If you would like to use multiple different applications, create&nbsp;&lt;webapp tags with the same mount point and different host names and different location parameters.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual if you have any questions or need help, let us know at support@antwebsystems.com</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>We here at AntWebsystems are pretty
                good with Apache OFBiz and all related software. We do however hate
                hardware&nbsp;which needs to be ordered,&nbsp;wait until you finally get it, has
                start-up fees, rack space fees etc, etc. On top of that we also do
                not like license fees!
                </p><br><p>Guess what, that is all history now. We
                have switched our physical servers and the servers of our clients to
                the Amazon EC2 cloud. We can start new- and stop exiting servers at
                any time, use load balancers, disks and more and use it instantly, so
                no waiting time.</p><p><br></p><p style="font-size:large"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">So how is that done?</span></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Signup.</strong></p><p>Go to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/</a>
                and sign-up to the EC2 services using your credit card. On Amazon you
                pay what you have used and there are no start-up fees. Running a
                server for a an hour will cost you 34 dollar cents. See the (<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#pricing">http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#pricing</a>)
                for more info.
                </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Create the server instance.</strong></p><p>Create your server instance and use the community OFBiz&nbsp;instance we created. You can search
                on the word OFBiz) This can take some time because the number of
                available instances is already pretty high.&nbsp;Then select or create a key pair and download the key pair when it
                is new. After that configure the firewall in a separate security
                group. Open the ports 22 (ssh) 80 (http) and 443 (https). After that&nbsp;review the setup&nbsp;and confirm the creation: the server will be
                started up! This will take a couple of minutes.</p><br><p><strong>Login with SSH.</strong></p><p>When it is started you are able the access it by using the public
                domain name shown in the instance description. Use the ssh -i
                parameter to point to the private key you have downloaded. You can
                login as the user 'root'.
                </p><br><p><strong>OFBiz in the Webbrowser.</strong></p><p>Also OFBiz will work directly using the public dns you used for
                the SSH and adding /ecommerce will show the demo ecommerce site and
                /catalog will show the login page. You can login using the username
                'admin' and password 'ofbiz'</p><br><p><strong>What system do you have?</strong></p><p>You have now a fully functional OFBiz system with a recent version
                of the OFBiz trunk installed in the user 'ofbiz' using Apache
                webserver as the front-end proxy server and PostgreSQl as the
                database, all under Ubuntu Linux as the operating system without any
                license fees!</p><br><p><strong>Run it under your domain name.</strong></p><p>The next step would be to assign an elastic ip address to it in
                EC2 and use it with your domain name in your local DNS or use the
                Amazon DNS Route 53 system.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>AWS problem: a single instance can only have a single IP.</strong></p><p>If you would like to run several https
                sites on the same instance, you need several ip's for that instance
                and that is not possible. There is however a workaround. You can
                create a load balancer for every https site and allocate these load
                balancers to the same instance. This is not possible with the menus,
                but is possible with the command line interface which you can
                download in the developer tools section. With the command line you
                can allocate more than one load balancer to the same instance. The
                load balancer can also take care of the SSL certificate and all
                outputs (http and converted https) of all balancers can be routed to
                the same '80' port of the instance. We already changed OFBiz so OFBiz
                can see if the original request was a http or a https request.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Need help?</strong></p><p>If you need help getting this implemented, let us know, we can can

                <![CDATA[<p>AntWebsystems now completed the email mailing list function in
                Apache OFBiz and integrated the function with the rest of the system.
                It allows users on your site to subscribe to a mailing list and you
                to send out messages to your subscribers. It will also allow you to
                create other specific mailing lists on a selection of the people
                and/or companies in the party component. An example is to select all
                customers from a specific country and write them an email for their
                specific needs. Also functions are provided to unsubscribe. A contact
                list is related to a website/productstore where all templates reside.
                The contactlist can also be used for calling lists and normal paper
                mailings.</p><br><p><strong>System setup.<br></strong>We assume you have a working OFBiz
                e-commerce system where the website and product store are defined.
                Then you have to specify email templates in the product store (in
                catalog) to enable the system to send a subscribe confirmation, an
                unsubscribe notification, an unsubscribe verification and an email
                template which can be used to send email to your subscribers which
                also contains a unsubscribe link.</p><br><p>The next thing you have to do is to
                create a 'contactlist' in the marketing component which relates to
                the website/productstore you have used before. This contact list id
                you have to use on your e-commerce site. In the standard OFBiz trunk
                download there is demo data which shows an example how to set up a
                contact list.</p><br><p><strong>Creating contact list from existing
                parties.<br></strong>If you would like to send an email to
                certain parties in the party component you can generate a contact
                list with specific parties you specify ion the selection which can be
                on role and postal address.</p><br><p><strong>Send an email to the contact
                list.</strong><br>You have now set up the system to be able to use it. You
                can create an email to be send to subscribers of a contact list by
                selecting an existing contactlist in the marketing component and
                press the “CommEvents' tab. Click then on 'new communication' and
                enter your message to be send.</p><br><p>The system will now start sending the
                communication email to all subscribers of the contact list. When an
                email does not exist and is bounced, the related email address will
                be automatically be unsubscribed.<br>
                </p><br><p><strong>Subscribe.<br></strong>A user can subscribe on the e-commerce
                front-end by entering an email address. The system will send a
                confirmation email and when the user replied to it will try add this
                user to the contact list. The system will also look if the email
                already exists with a party and link the subscription to it.</p><br><p><strong>Unsubscribe.<br></strong>If a user wants to unsubscribe he can use the email link in the
                last message which was sent to him or go to the e-commerce site and
                enter the related email address and press the unsubscribe button, he
                will be sent a confirmation message to which he can reply to
                unsubscribe. To unsubscribe is also possible in the online profile
                where all subscribed contact lists are listed.</p><br><p>As usual if you need help in this area let us know at

                <![CDATA[<div>Now most of our customers use the scrum system, there was a need to have a short overview, how to use the scrum component within our AntWebsystems ERP system.</div>
                <div><br>
                </div>
                <div>We also have now upgraded the demo system which is available at&nbsp;http://growerpbackend.growerpdemo.com/scrumdemo/control/main The text below uses this demo system and shows the related screens which are explained in the text.&nbsp;</div>
                <div>On the first screen of this demo system we have defined a number of demo logins which provide you an easy start in the system. The first screen also lists some Scrum explanation documents which you should read before reading the text below.</div>
                <div><br>
                </div>
                <div>First of all why do we want to use this methodology?</div>
                <div><br>
                </div>
                <div>
                <strong>Scrum has number of advantages:</strong>
                </div>
                <div>
                <ol>
                <li>Development requirements are often not known in detail, this method can cope with that.</li>
                <li>With every delivery (=sprint) you get a usable system or function which you can use in a production environment.</li>
                <li>Every sprint in the total project can be seen as a fixed price phase in the project if a fixed price project is required.</li>
                <li>The development process is completely transparent to all participants in the project including the project owner and stakeholders. All worked and planned hours, tasks, in/outgoing email, all actual program changes, everything can be seen at any time.</li>
                <li>Fixed time frames for deliveries, so a delivery is never late, however can contain less or more, so the content can be adjusted to be agreed with the product owner, not the date of delivery.</li>
                </ol>
                </div>
                <div><br>
                </div>
                <div>
                <strong>What are the tasks of the product owner?</strong>
                </div>
                <div>
                <ol>
                <li>Maintain the product backlog: a current to-do list where all the requirements for a product function are listed according to how profitable they are. At the top the most profitable ones.</li>
                <li>Answer any questions the implementation (Scrum) team will have.</li>
                <li>Although we do perform QA within the development company, the product owner is responsible to organize the acceptance tests.</li>
                </ol>
                </div>
                <div>The product owner is a single point of contact in the customer organization. Any other person in the organization can be registered as a stakeholder who can login but only has read access. The stakeholder can only change the backlog through the product owner.</div>
                <div><br>
                </div>
                <div>
                <strong>The most important part: the product backlog</strong>.</div>
                <div>We have two versions within our OFBiz Scrum system:&nbsp;</div>
                <div>
                <ol>
                <li>A mostly read only version which initially list all 'open' backlog items but can list any backlog item (implemented or not) and has a search facility. The scrum team however can update the estimates here.<a href="http://growerpbackend.growerpdemo.com/scrum/control/ViewTotalBacklog?productId=DEMO-PRODUCT-1&amp;USERNAME=productowner&amp;PASSWORD=ofbiz&amp;JavaScriptEnabled=Y" target="_blank">(demo system screen here)</a>
                </li>
                <li>A product owner version which lists only list the open, not yet started items and where new backlog items can be added, updated, deleted, categorized and ordered.<a href="https://ofbizdemo.antwebsystems.com/scrum/control/AddProdBacklog?productId=DEMO-PRODUCT-1&amp;USERNAME=productowner&amp;PASSWORD=ofbiz&amp;JavaScriptEnabled=Y%20" target="_blank">(demo system screen)</a>
                </li>
                </ol>
                </div>
                <div>
                <strong>Reading the sprint overview.</strong>
                </div>
                <div>As a product owner (or stakeholder) you have full read access to the scrum sprint. There you can see general information, on a daily basis, where the hours worked are being used and who the members are.<a href="https://ofbizdemo.antwebsystems.com/scrum/control/ViewSprint?sprintId=DEMO-SPRINT-1&amp;projectId=DEMO-PROJECT-1&amp;USERNAME=productowner&amp;PASSWORD=ofbiz&amp;JavaScriptEnabled=Y" target="_blank">(demo system screen)</a>
                </div>
                <div><br>
                </div>
                <div>
                <strong>The burn down chart.</strong>
                </div>
                <div>At the "burn down chart” on the sprint overview, you see quickly if the sprint is on track, by comparing the 'ideal' remaining hours to the 'actual' remaining hours.&nbsp;</div>
                <div>If the actual hours are lower, the sprint has time left, so is ahead. If this is the case and the amount is substantial, then it could be considered to add another backlog item.</div>
                <div>If the actual hours are higher, the sprint has not time enough, so is behind. If this is the case and the amount is substantial, then it could be considered to remove another backlog item.</div>
                <div>Remember, the end date cannot be changed.</div>
                <div><br>
                </div>
                <div>Adding or removing backlog items of a sprint is always done in agreement with the product owner.</div>
                <div><br>
                </div>
                <div>Again, if you have any questions or comments, let us know at support@antwebsystems.com.</div>
